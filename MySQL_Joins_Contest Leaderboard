Refer to a SQL problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/contest-leaderboard/problem?isFullScreen=true&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen

Solution:
SELECT m.hacker_id, h.name, SUM(m.score) AS tot_score
FROM (SELECT hacker_id, challenge_id, MAX(score) AS score
      FROM Submissions
      GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id) AS m
INNER JOIN Hackers AS h
ON m.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
GROUP BY m.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING tot_score > 0
ORDER BY tot_score DESC, m.hacker_id;

Note:
Since the problem asks to select only maximum score, it is better to create a data set containing only max scores and sum them up.
