Refer to a SQL problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/challenges/problem?isFullScreen=true

Solution:
SELECT C.hacker_id, H.name, COUNT(C.challenge_id) AS totnumchal
FROM Hackers AS H
INNER JOIN Challenges AS C
ON H.hacker_id = C.hacker_id
GROUP BY C.hacker_id, H.name
HAVING totnumchal = (SELECT COUNT(C1.challenge_id)
                     FROM Challenges AS C1
                     GROUP BY C1.hacker_id
                     ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1) OR
       totnumchal NOT IN (SELECT COUNT(C2.challenge_id)
                          FROM Challenges AS C2
                          GROUP BY C2.hacker_id
                          HAVING C2.hacker_id != C.hacker_id)
ORDER BY totnumchal DESC, C.hacker_id;

Note:
- The chunck of code seen below selects unique hacker_id(s)
SELECT COUNT(C2.challenge_id)
FROM Challenges AS C2
GROUP BY C2.hacker_id
HAVING C2.hacker_id != C.hacker_id

- The part of code below selects unique number of challenge_id from unique hacker_id
totnumchal NOT IN (~)
